## 01 - Always run the latest React Native version to access the new features
- So you'll get better performance, newer features and easier updating work

## 02- How to debug faster and better with Flipper
- In React Native you may need the debug two layers. One is JS part and the other one is Native part. To debug native part you can use XCode or Android Studio.
- It is a desktop app with a convenient interface, which directly integrates with your application’s JS and native code. This means that you no lon- ger have to worry about JS runtime differences and the performance caveats of using the Chrome Debugger.
- Flipper lets you preview logs from native code and track native crashes, so you don’t have to run Android Studio or Xcode to check what is happening on the native side!

## 03 - Avoid unused native dependencies
- Issue: You have a lot of dependencies in your project but you don’t know if you need all of them
- Improve the Time to Interactive of your app by removing the linking of unused dependencies.
- Solution: Find and remove unused dependencies. Use sth like `npx depcheck`
- Removing a few unused native dependencies ended up reducing both the size of the app bundle and TTI by around 17%.

## 04 - Optimize your application startup time with Hermes
