## Lesson 2 : Why Teach Financial Literacy?

We need to learn accounting. This is important.

Rule 1 : You have to know the difference between actives and passives and you put you money on actives. Riches buy actives, poors buy passives.

Actives are the things which put money in your pocket. Passive is a thing which take money from your pocket.

Actives gives you money and you can buy more actives. This is a positive loop.

Wealth is the ability to survive your remaining life when you quit your job today.

When your actives meet your expenses you are financially free.

## Lesson 3 : Mind Your Own Business

> Don't be a worker. Do your own business.

Actives:

1. Businesses which you own but not work.
2. Stocks
3. Bonds
4. Partnership - Shareholder of companies
5. Real estates which generates income
6. Patents etc.
7. Anything which values increases or generates income

Luxes must be purchased with money from actives. Not with direct income.

## Lesson 4 : The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations

Tax advantages A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot, like pay expenses before paying taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed, and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. Its one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They're easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cashflow. For example, by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company expenses. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on. But it’s done legally with pre-tax dollars.

Compaines earn, expense and then pay taxes. Workers earn, pay taxes then expenses.
