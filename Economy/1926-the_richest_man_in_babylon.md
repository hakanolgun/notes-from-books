## The Man Who Desired Gold

Bansir is a chariot builder. His best friend is musician Kobbi. Both are wage earners. Bansir tells his friend why he thinks they don't have much gold in this rich city:

"Never in all those years did I think like this before. From early dawn until darkness stopped me, I have labored to build the finest chariots any man could make, soft- heartedly hoping some day the Gods would recognize my worthy deeds and bestow upon me great prosperity. This they have never done. At last, I realize this they will never do. Therefore, my heart is sad. I wish to be a man of means. I wish to own lands and cattle, to have fine robes and coins in my purse. I am willing to work for these things with all the strength in my back, with all the skill in my hands, with all the cunning in my mind, but I wish my labors to be fairly rewarded. What is the matter with us?

Again I ask you! Why cannot we have our just share of the good things so plentiful for those who have the gold with which to buy them?"

## The Richest Man In Babylon

"And, when I realized all this, I decided to myself that I would claim my share of the good things of life. I would not be one of those who stand afar off, enviously watching others enjoy. I would not be content to clothe myself in the cheapest raiment that looked respectable. I would not be satisfied with the lot of a poor man. On the contrary, I would make myself a guest at this banquet of good things.

"Being, as you know, the son of a humble merchant, one of a large family with no hope of an inheritance, and not being endowed, as you have so frankly said, with superior powers or wisdom, I decided that if I was to achieve what I desired, time and study would be required.

He asked to Algamish the money lender how to become rich. Algamish said to him "When i decide to keep a part of my earnings as saving i found the way to become rich. You can do it too"

“A part of all you earn is yours to keep. It should be not less than a tenth no matter how little you earn. It can be as much more as you can afford. Pay yourself first. Do not buy from the clothes-maker and the sandal-maker more than you can pay out of the rest and still have enough for food and charity and penance to the gods.

“Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow. The sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow. And the more faithfully you nourish and water that tree with consistent savings, the sooner may you bask in contentment beneath its shade.'

Again, twelve months later, Algamish came to the room of the scribes and addressed me.

’’What progress have you made since last I saw you?”

"I have paid myself faithfully,' I replied, 'and my savings I have entrusted to Agger the shield maker, to buy bronze, and each fourth month he does pay me the rental.”

"That is good. And what do you do with the rental?' "I do have a great feast with honey and fine wine and spiced cake. Also I have bought me a scarlet tunic. And some day I shall buy me a young ass upon which to ride.” To which Algamish laughed, “You do eat the children of your savings. Then how do you expect them to work for you?

And how can they have children that will also work for you?

First get thee an army of golden slaves and then many a rich banquet may you enjoy without regret.” So saying he again went away.

"Arkad,” he continued, “you have learned your lessons well. You first learned to live upon less than you could earn. Next you learned to seek advice from those who were competent through their own experiences to give it. And, lastly, you have learned to make gold work for you.”

"You have taught yourself how to acquire money, how to keep it, and how to use it. Therefore, you are competent for a responsible position. I am becoming an old man. My sons think only of spending and give no thought to earning. My interests are great and I fear too much for me to look after. If you will go to Nippur and look after my lands there, I shall make you my partner and you shall share in my estate.”

"So I went to Nippur and took charge of his holdings, which were large. And because I was full of ambition and because I had mastered the three laws of successfully handling wealth, I was enabled to increase greatly the value of his properties.

"What then do you advise us to do that we also may become rich?" asked still another of his friends. "The years have passed and we are no longer young men and we have nothing put by."

“"I advise that you take the wisdom of Algamish and say to yourselves, **_'A part of all I earn is mine to keep.'_** Say it in the morning when you first arise. Say it at noon. Say it at night. Say it each hour of every day. Say it to yourself until the words stand out like letters of fire across the sky.

"Impress yourself with the idea. Fill yourself with the thought. Then take whatever portion seems wise. Let it be not less than one-tenth and lay it by. Arrange your other expenditures to do this if necessary. But lay by that portion first. Soon you will realize what a rich feeling it is to own a treasure upon which you alone have claim. As it grows it will stimulate you. A new joy of life will thrill you.

Greater efforts will come to you to earn more. For of your increased earnings, will not the same percentage be also yours to keep?

"Then learn to make your treasure work for you. Make it your slave. Make its children and its children's children work for you.

"Insure an income for thy future. Look thou at the aged and forget not that in the days to come thou also will be numbered among them. Therefore invest thy treasure with greatest caution that it be not lost. Usurious rates of return are deceitful sirens that sing but to lure the unwary upon the rocks of loss and remorse.

"Provide also that thy family may not want should the Gods call thee to their realms. For such protection it is always possible to make provision with small payments at regular intervals. Therefore the provident man delays not in expectation of a large sum becoming available for such a wise purpose.

"Counsel with wise men. Seek the advice of men whose daily work is handling money. Let them save you from such an error as I myself made in entrusting my money to the judgment of Azmur, the brickmaker. A small return and a safe one is far more desirable than risk.

"Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much. If one-tenth of all you earn is as much as you can comfortably keep, be content to keep this portion. Live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy."

## Seven Cures For a Lean Purse

King Sargon, asked Arkad to teach people how to become rich. Arkad accepted and started to teach seven cure.

## The First Cure - Start thy purse to fattening

Save one in tenth in every money you own. Only expence nine in tenth.

## The Second Cure - Control thy expenditures

Never cut that one in tenth. If your income is small, make a budget and cut some expenses.

## The Third Cure - Make thy gold multiply

The gold which we save from our income is just a beginning. Gold that we earn from this gold will be our wealth.

Rent your money. When you get interest. Next time rent your money with that. Snowball effect.

## The Fourth Cure - Guard thy treasures from loss

Invest something which your capital is safe. Don't start risky business with the affect of your friends or relatives. Never lend your money someone you are not sure pay back. The man which you will do business should be professional and expert of that area.

## The Fifth Cure - Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment

If you are paying rent, buy your own house and pay that credit like your rent. Owning a house make you happy and lifefull.

## The Sixth Cure - Insure a future income

Start to create a saving for your old ages or your families needs. Burying gold is risky. Buying land or flat better. Or invest that money.

## The Seventh Cure - Increase thy ability to earn

Kişi zayıf cüzdana karşı yedi çarenin kurallarını öğrenip kendi alanındaki kişilerin fikrini alarak bilgi paylaşımı yapmalıdır. Mesela tüccarsa daha iyi malları daha ucuza almak için çalışmalıdır.

Ayrıca:

- “Ailesine iyi bakmalıdır ki onun hakkında iyi düşünüp iyi konuşsunlar.

- “Vasiyetini hazırlamalıdır ki tanrılar onu yanına çağırdığında mülkleri uygun ve onurlu bir şekilde bölünebilsin.
