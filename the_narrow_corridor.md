# PREFACE

This book is about liberty, and how and why human societies have achieved or failed to achieve it.

Where does liberty come from? Not from Assad's dictatorship and also not from the anarchy that followed the collapse of the Syrian state.

Our answer is simple. Liberty needs the state and the laws. But it is not given by the state or the elites controlling it. It is taken by regular people, by society. Society needs to control the state.

Our argument in this book is that for liberty to emerge and flourish, both state and society must be strong. A strong state is needed to control violence, enforce laws, provide services. A strong society needed to control the strong state.

Squeezed between the despotic states and the anarchy is a narrow corridor to liberty. In this corridor state and society balance each other out. This is not a one time achievement. This is a every day competing. This is not a door. This is a corridor to walk.

It is a process because the state and its elites must learn to live with the shackles society puts on them and different segments of society have to learn to work together despite their differences.

# 1. HOW DOES HISTORY END?

Thommas Hobbes's terms is Warre which is similar to anarchy.

"If any two men desire the same thing which they cannot bot enjoy, they become enemies... endeavor to destroy one an other."

Anarchy emerges when men live without a common power to keep them all in awe. Hobbes dubbed this common power the **Leviathan** or **Common-Wealth** or **state** interchangeably. Solution to Warre is to create a centralized authority.

Hobbes understood that the all-powerful Leviathan would be feared. But better to fear one powerful Leviathan than to fear everybody.

How to get a Leviathan? Hobbes proposed two routes. First one is people submit their wills to his will, and their judgements to his judgement. So a sort of grand social contract. The second one is by force. Somebody will emerge in anarchy and destroy his enemies and become Leviathan. Both ways ends up to end of Warre.

Hobbes' theree ways to govern a state: monarch, aristocracy or democracy.

Hobbes was right about avoiding anarchy. But there was also much that Hobbes didn't get right. For one, it turns out that stateless societies are quite capable of controlling violence, though as we'll see this doesn't bring much liberty. For another, he was too optimistic about the liberty that states would bring.

Nazi Germany and Communist China shows that leviathan can be bad also. The state finished anarchy but it murder his people, monitor them etc.

Hobbes was also wrong about the stateless means violance. There are societies which has no leviathan but in order and no violence. Mbuti Pygmies, Akan people of Ghana and Cote D'Ivoire. But people of these societies gave their freedom. No liberty.
